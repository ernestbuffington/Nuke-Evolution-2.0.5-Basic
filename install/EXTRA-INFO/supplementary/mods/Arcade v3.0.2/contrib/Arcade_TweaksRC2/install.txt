/**
 * 
 * 
 * Arcade Tweaks 1.0 RC2
 * 
 *         There was 2 "big" bugs in the RC1
 *                 - links was "linked" to the root.. so didnt work on nuke system not
 *                 installed in the root directory of the server.
 *                 - For people that had the Comment Mod of JRSweet installed, Comments wasn't
 *                  added and could cause an "error of authentification" when user tried to 
 *                 submit comment.
 *                     NB: Look the Tools menu , there is a little function to fix that.. :)
 *     
 *   - release candidate version 2
 *   - Installation
 *   - Upload html/* to your root directory
 *   - Go to your Nuke Modules admin panel and activate Arcade Tweaks
 *   - You should change default permission in Admin panel for "Administrator"
 *     you can also set it as "invisible". (BTW , there is a Admin check so 
 *        shouldnt be a problem)
 * 
 *      If you have already installed the Pre-release... Just overwrite yours files.
 *   (NB: There is 2 mores little gif files in images)
