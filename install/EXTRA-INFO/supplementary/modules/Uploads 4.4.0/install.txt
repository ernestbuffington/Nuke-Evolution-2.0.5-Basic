   1.2 Execute the uploads_4_4_0.sql (located in the sql folder) in phpMyAdmin
   1.3 CHMOD the folder /files to 777 (If your host is running PHP as CGI, set its to 755 and make sure proper pemissions is set in config.php)

   2.3 Point your browser to the following location:

       http://www.yoursite.com/modules.php?name=Uploads

       -> This will install the necessary database tables
       -> After you have successfully installed the tables, you should be
          redirected to a new page where you can set up the patch.
          
          NOTE: There's already a folder available in the root directory of
                your website called /files. Make sure you have CHMODDED it to
                777. If you want to store your files somewhere else, you can
                safely delete this folder. (If your host is running PHP as CGI,
				set it to 755 and make sure proper pemissions is set in config.php)
