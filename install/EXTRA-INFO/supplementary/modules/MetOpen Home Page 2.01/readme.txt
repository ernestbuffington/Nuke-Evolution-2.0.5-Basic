Purpose:
This module will give you the ability to make a nicer looking home page using phpnuke. 
You can have special areas for features, news articles and tips and control how it all looks 
including number of articles and a two column display. Plus admins have access to administrator 
functions right on the home page.


-------------------------------
Installation:
1. For users of previous versions: back up your MetOpen_Home_Page/language/lang-english.php file for your reference so it will help you recreate your settings in step #3.
2. Copy the files within the html folder into your phpnuke root directory. You can skip the class folder if you dont plan on using the "print to pdf" feature. You can skip the googletap directory if you aren't using googletap.
3. Open your language file in the language directory eg "MetOpen_Home_Page/language/lang-english.php" and set the appropriate values in the features, articles and tips section.
4. Activate this module and set it as home.
