Shout Box installation instructions
============================================

First: Review Minimum Requirements.txt

1) REMOVE OLD:
     -Remove all old files, blocks, images, and directories when upgrading from v3.5.
     -Do not use this shout box in conjunction with any other shout box.
     -See 'remove old files.txt' to see which files you may safely remove.
     -Remove old language file definitions from admin area. They moved to module area to avoid overwrites.

2) SQL:
     -Upload SB_SQL_installer.php (in the sql directory) to your nuke root folder (the one mainfile.php is in).
     -Open your web browser (Opera, Firefox, Mozilla, or Netscape recommended).
     -Login as Super Administrator (GOD)
     -Browse to the file (example: http://www.mysite.com/SB_SQL_installer.php).
     -Follow on-screen instructions.
     -Delete SB_SQL_installer.php from your server when SQL install is complete.
     -If this method fails, you do have the option of the .sql file to upload to phpMyAdmin.

3) LANGUAGE DEFINITIONS:
     -Some languages are included but may be incomplete.
     -If you need a different language, you will have to create them yourself. (some are available for download).
     -Some definitions may be missing or incorrect, you will have to edit them yourself in Wordpad or KATE. Do not use Word.
     -3 areas of definitions:
        -Module: /modules/Shout_Box/language/
        -Block: /modules/Shout_Box/lang-block/
        -Admin: /modules/Shout_Box/lang-admin/
     -I am seeking new definitions for other languages. My E-Mail: webmaster@ourscripts.net

4) UPLOAD NEW FILES:
     -Upload files within the html directory to your website/server.
     -All files should be placed in corresponding directories on your server to what they are in the html directory.
     -Make sure to upload BOTH admin areas. Each has different capabilities.
     -Example: /Shout_Box/public_html/blocks/block-Shout_Box.php uploads to public_html/blocks/block-Shout_Box.php
     -Make sure you upload and overwrite all files. Make their permissions 644 -rw-r--r--
     -Make sure directory permissions are set at 755 drwxr-xr-x

5) THEME COLORING: Go to the Themeing tab in the admin area. Each theme will have a default color for each area. Adjust them to your liking.
    -A good starting point for a light colored theme is: #EBEBEB #FFFFFF #BBBBBB #EBEBEB #FFFFFF
    -A good starting point for a dark colored theme is: #000000 #212121 #000000 #101010 #212121

6) THEME IMAGES: There are two sections of theme images, Box Arrows and Box Background. You can control them in the Themeing tab in the admin area. Here are a few things to remember when using this area:

    -BOX ARROWS are mandatory to have.
    -The Black.gif arrow set is used by default.
    -If you make your own box arrows:
         -Make sure they are 9 pixels wide and 5 pixels high.
         -Do not put spaces in the image names. Use _ instead.
         -If you name your images according to their hex value: FFFFFF.gif, do not put # in the name.
         -Make sure you create all 3 with the same name, but place each image in thier respective directories.
         -Use this pattern for making them: /up/Black.gif   /down/Black.gif   /pause/Black.gif
         -You can use any image type: .gif .png .jpg .bmp etc...
         -If you upload a new up image, but do not have a down or pause image yet, you will not have the choice to use it until you have a matching set.
         -Upload your new image set to modules/Shout_Box/images/down/  modules/Shout_Box/images/up/ and   modules/Shout_Box/images/pause/
        -After uploading an image set, refresh the Themeing tab in admin, the option for it will appear.
    -Make sure you at least have the Black.gif image set uploaded. If any images aren't available, the black set is used.
    -If you install a new theme, default colors will be set for it.

    -BOX BACKGROUNDS are optional and are off for each theme by default.
    -Some background images come with the Shout Box.
    -Although these images look nice, they might not be the correct size for your setup. If this is true, you will have to make your own.
    -If you set a background image, the Shout Box 1 and 2 colors set in Theme Coloring are ignored.
    -If your background image becomes inaccessable, the Shout Box reverts back to the alternating colors set in Theme Coloring.
    -Background images will tile if the shout box scroll area is larger than the background image.
    -It is ok if the scroll area is smaller than the background image.
    -If you make your own background images:
        -Do not put spaces in the image names. Use _ instead.
        -Upload them to modules/Shout_Box/images/background/
        -After uploading an image, refresh the Themeing tab in admin, the option for it will appear.
        -Remember that is the image KB is too large, it will take your users a long time to download it.
        -Try to stay under 10kb.
        -If you use the shout box in the center position, try to make an image that tiles nicely.
        -Remember people have to read the scrolling text. Try to not make an image that obscures it.
        -Apply the background image and get your friends advice about it.
        -Have a background image you'd like to include in the Shout Box distribution? E-mail me: webmaster@ourscripts.net

7) ADMIN SETTINGS:
    -Log into phpnuke as an administrator
    -Go to Blocks and activate Shout Box. Recommended set to 'All Visitors'.
    -Go to Modules and activate Shout Box. Recommended set to 'All Visitors'.
    -Go to the Shout Box icon within the admin panel and set your preferences.
    -Users of PHP-Nuke v7.5+ can now add module administrators for managing shouts and bans.

8) Removed!

9) CSS in theme check.
    -Open /themes/<YOUR_THEME>/style/style.css in an editor like wordpad or KATE.
    -Make sure you have set the TD section to cover fonts. Here is an example:

TD
{
font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,serif;
font-size: 11px;
margin: 0px;
color: #000000;
}

10) FIGHTING SPAM
    -Please read Fighting spam.txt

11) CONVERSION TOOL
    -This only applies to previous users of the shout box.
    -Shouts are saved in a new format now and the need has come up for this conversion too.
    -Converting your shouts to the new format is not mandatory, but is highly recommended.
    -Upload the conversion tool to the directory mainfile.php is in.
    -Run it in the browser and follow onscreen instructions.
    -I realize that this tool is likely to create some confusion. If you need help, come to our user support forum:
