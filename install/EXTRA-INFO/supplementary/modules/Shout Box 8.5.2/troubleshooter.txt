Shout Box - Troubleshooter
============================================

Problem: The format of the time and date of shouts changes when I login.

Solution:
  -This is correct behavior. Details:
    -The shout box follows each user's date format setting in their profile.
    -If you want to see a different format, go to Your Account -> Your Info -> Forums Date format
    -Changing this will not affect other logged in user's time and date format.

------------------------------------

Problem: The time a shout is shouted changes when a user logs in.

Solution:
  This is correct behavior. Details:
    -The shout box calculates the difference between the server time and the user's timezone set in their preferences.
    -When a user logs out, it can no longer use a setting from that person, so it instead uses server time and the server offset.

------------------------------------

Problem: I just shouted in the box and the time doesnt match my local time.

Solution:
  -Check the server time in shout box admin area.
  -Check your timezone setting in your preferences:
    -Your Account -> Your Info -> Forums timezone
  -Note: The default timezone for users is +10 which is most likely incorrect. Encourage your user's update their profile.

------------------------------------

Problem: The text is the wrong color or size

Solution:
   -Adjust TD, class content, or class title in your themes (themes/YOUR_THEME/style/style.css).

------------------------------------

Problem: Shout Box is too wide/narrow

Solution:
  -Decrease/increase the 'Block input box width'. This is not measured in pixels.
  -Decrease the amount of 'Smilies per row'

------------------------------------

Problem: Shout Box is too wide when the smilies drop open

Solution:
  -Decrease the amount of 'Smilies per row'

------------------------------------

Problem: A different block's information appears when clicking the copyright symbol at the bottom of the module.
  -One of your blocks is using the same code and is overrunning the module. Contact that block's creator.
  -This will happen to all of your modules, not just the shout box.

------------------------------------

Problem: Shout Box doesn't scroll or work

Check:
  -No shouts in database. Try posting one.
  -Check shout history for any shouts. If none present, try posting a shout.
  -Disable any Source Code Encryption (some themes have this, some dont).
  -Javascript is disabled in your browser. Re-enable it.
  -Make sure shoutbox.js is in your nuke root (directory mainfile.php is in).
  -Check for shoutbox SQL tables in phpMyadmin and see if they exist.
  -Check permissions: files should be 644 and directories should be 755.
  -A second block on the site uses javascript. See install.txt section 8.
  -If you are loading images from another site like a paypal donate image, host the image locally. The shout box won't start scrolling until the page is fully loaded.

------------------------------------

Problem: Text in Shout Box admin area, block, or module look like this: _SHOUTTEXT

Check:
  -You haven't uploaded the modules directory. /modules/Shout_Box/
  -Not all languages are provided. Create your own in:
    -Admin: /modules/Shout_Box/lang-admin/
    -Block: /modules/Shout_Box/lang-block/
    -Module: /modules/Shout_Box/language/
  -Check language definition repository at OurScripts.net in the downloads area under PHP-Nuke language.
  -If only a few definitions are missing, you will need to create the translations for them.

------------------------------------

Problem: After clicking the Shout Box icon in the admin area, it tells me my current condition is marginal or critical.

Solution:
  -Click the analyze button and follow its recommendations.

------------------------------------

Problem: Fatal error: Call to undefined function: html_entity_decode()

Solution: Upgrade your PHP version to a minimum 4.3.0

------------------------------------

Problem: Any other problem

Check:
   -Check for a newer version of shout box at OurScripts.net
   -Have the SQL repair tool built into SB_SQL_installer.php scan your database for problems.
   -Go to the Layout tab in admin and repair any problems that the Setup and Security monitor report.
