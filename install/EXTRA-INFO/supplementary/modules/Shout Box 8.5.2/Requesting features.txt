Shout Box - Requesting features
============================================

Hello everyone! I, Aric Bolf (SuperCat), am the current developer of this Shout Box.
I am thankful for everyone's input. A lot of features begin with people
requesting them. I have a forum set up just for this type of thing.
However, there are a few features i do not want any more requests for:

1. Having the shout box not refresh the whole page when posting.
2. Removing or turning off the scrolling.

If you have a request other than these, please feel free to submit a request.

Before submitting a request:

 1. Check to make sure you have the latest version. Your request may already exist.
 2. Check the work board to see if the feature is slated to be made.
 3. Check thru the requests forum to see if others have requested that feature. If it is, reply to it with your thoughts.
