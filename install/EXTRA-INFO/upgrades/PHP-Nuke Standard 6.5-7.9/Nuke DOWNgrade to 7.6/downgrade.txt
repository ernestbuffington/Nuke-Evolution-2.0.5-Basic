/*****[NUKE-EVOLUTION BASIC: Upgrade users ]*************************

 Before You Begin
 ----------------
 If you have not read the readme.txt in the previous folder you MUST
 do so before you continue.
 
 This upgrade is meant for those users with a PHP-Nuke version between 
 7.7 and 7.9.  If this is not you then you need to STOP!
 
 Read EACH step COMPLETELY before attempting that step!!!
 
 First Step
 ----------
 Upload the correct downgrade-7x-76.php file that matches your current version.
 
 For example if you have Nuke 7.7 right now you need to upload downgrade-77-76.php
 
 Second Step
 -----------
 Run http://www.yoursite.com/downgrade-7x-76.php
 
 If you see an error when creating the database it might be that the field
 exists because you had the mod already installed.  If you are unsure of the
 errors you get or you are having a problem after the install please contact
 us for help.

 To help us better understand the problem you should WRITE DOWN the errors
 so when asked what they were you can tell us.  Copy and paste into notepad
 is a good way to keep them.
 
 Third Step
 ----------
 Return to the Third Step in the readme.txt located in the previous folder
