/*****[NUKE-EVOLUTION BASIC: Upgrade users ]*************************

 Before You Begin
 ----------------
 If you have not read the readme.txt in the previous folder you MUST
 do so before you continue.
 
 THIS WILL DELETE EVERYTHING ELSE!!!
 
 Read EACH step COMPLETELY before attempting that step!!!
 
 First Step
 ----------
 Delete all file and folders
  
 Second Step
 -----------
 Copy all the Evo files (html/) to your server.  Delete or skip uploading 
 the install.php file and the install/ folder.
 
 Third Step
 ----------
 Upload upgrade.php and upgrade/ folder located in this folder to your
 website's root.
 
 Fourth Step
 -----------
 Run http://www.yoursite.com/upgrade.php
 
 Follow the prompts in the installer until it completes.
 
 If you see the safe mode error or you wish to manually install everything,
 see the manual upgrade steps below. Then return to the Fifth step
 
 If you see an error when creating the database it might be that the field
 exists because you had the mod already installed.  If you are unsure of the
 errors you get or you are having a problem after the install please contact
 us for help.

 To help us better understand the problem you should WRITE DOWN the errors
 so when asked what they were you can tell us.  Copy and paste into notepad
 is a good way to keep them.

 Fifth Step
 ----------
 Return to the Third Step in the readme.txt located in the previous folder
