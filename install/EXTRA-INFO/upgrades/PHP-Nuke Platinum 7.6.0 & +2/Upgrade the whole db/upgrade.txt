/*****[NUKE-EVOLUTION BASIC: Upgrade the whole DB ]******************

 Before You Begin
 ----------------
 If you have not read the readme.txt in the previous folder you MUST
 do so before you continue.
 
 This will destroy Reviews.  If you have a working reviews module
 then you must change the installer to save it.  See save reviews
 below BEFORE YOU BEGIN.
 
 Once you have completed you will need to reconfigure NSN Supporters
 if you had modified it in anyway.
 
 Read EACH step COMPLETELY before attempting that step!!!
 
 First Step
 ----------
 Delete the following folders and files if they exist on your site.  Do
 not panic if you do not have these files or folders.  Some of them are 
 not standard in the install or were removed by the patch packs.
 
 PLEASE NOTE that the files and folders are sentinel not nukesentinel.  So
 DO NOT DELETE any nukesentinel files or folders.

 Second Step
 -----------
 Copy all the Evo files (html/) to your server.  Replace all the files and 
 folders that currently exist.  DO NOT have it append files!
 
 Delete or skip uploading the install.php file and the install/ folder.
 
 Third Step
 ----------
 Upload upgrade.php and upgrade/ folder located in this folder to your
 website's root.
 
 Fourth Step
 -----------
 Run http://www.yoursite.com/upgrade.php
 
 Follow the prompts in the installer until it completes.
 
 If you see the safe mode error or you wish to manually install everything,
 see the manual upgrade steps below.  Then return to the Fifth step.
 
 If you see an error when creating the database it might be that the field
 exists because you had the mod already installed.  If you are unsure of the
 errors you get or you are having a problem after the install please contact
 us for help.

 To help us better understand the problem you should WRITE DOWN the errors
 so when asked what they were you can tell us.  Copy and paste into notepad
 is a good way to keep them.

 Fifth Step
 ----------
 Return to the Third Step in the readme.txt located in the previous folder
 
 Manual Upgrade
 --------------
 
 DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU HAVE RUN THE INSTALLER AND IT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!!!
 
 Do Step 2 (- Change config.php) in the install help file (install/2-install.pdf[htm])

 folder
 
 Run the install.sql in the upgrade folder
 
 Run the upgrade.sql in the upgrade folder

 Run the nukesentinel.sql in the upgrade folder
 
 Do Step 5 (- CHMOD/Permissions) in the install help file (install/2-install.pdf[htm])
