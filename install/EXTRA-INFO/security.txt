 Passwords
 ---------
 Below are some tips to help you make your passwords more secure
 
 Your passwords should be no less than 5 characters if possible.
 Your passwords should contain an uppercase character.
 Your passwords should contain a lowercase character.
 Your passwords should contain a number.
 Your passwords should contain an alphanumeric if possible (i.e. *, #, $, !, etc)
 
 You should have different passwords for each of the following.  They should
 NEVER be the same.
 
 Admin
 DB
 Personal site user account
 FTP and/or site management
 User account on other sites
 
 Using the same password on other sites should NEVER be done.  The reason is now
 that site has your username and password.  Though the password is encrypted it
 can be decrypted with some work.  So now they have that password and guess what
 a hacker might do with it!
 
 Remember that different may not mean a whole new password but maybe a couple 
 of changes to it.
 
 For example Mypass#1 is a good password you can change it a number of different
 ways.
 MYPasS#1
 MyP8ss#1!
 myPASS#!
 MyPa$$#1
 
 You should change at least 3 of the characters though.

 Sentinel
 --------
 Do NOT turn off any of the blockers.  You can turn them down but you should
 never turn one all the way off!
 
 You should leave IP Tracking on but you can turn the length up or down

 Admin IP Lock
 -------------
 You should activate and use this mod if possible.  It locks the admin areas
 so only users with the correct IP address can access them.
 
 Please see help\features\Admin IP Lock.pdf for more information.
 
 User IP Lock
 ------------
 This is an optional security feature.  It locks user accounts 
 so only people with the correct IPs can login to them
